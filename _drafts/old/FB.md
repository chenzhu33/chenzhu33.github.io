## 1. intro

Sure, I have worked in Baidu Inputmethod department since 2016 and until last month, leading the android infrastructure team. 

The function of this team is providing basic infrastructure framework and improving application performance. Such as, we developed a react-native liked cross-platform framework which performs 3 times better than RN on memory cost and cold start time. And an Online apm framework, which can monitor ui-block, anr, crash, io problem, network failure and other problems without any code invasion. We also improved our apps performance which dramatically exceed the competitors in 29 performance indicators. You also can see these works in my resume.

So my duty in this team is to make project plans, design architectures and key  implementations. I also do some management works including project time management, ability improvement of team members and promote our projects to other teams in Baidu.

I will join Tencent this month later to lead a new social project

## 2. question

- Could you give me some more information about the new project, team size, belongs to which group, target users

- If I don't get H1B next year, I would be relocated to England, right? 
- So would the job also be rearranged?

## 3. 
I think the apm project is the most interesting one. We use a lot of black technologies in this project to implmement non invasive performace monitor.
